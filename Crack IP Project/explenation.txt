this will be my second project, includes a fue steps that will help me crack to local network wifi- WPA2 Private

step 1:
    deotitication: to be able to take somone out of the ip, the reason i do that is to not be depended of somone trying to connect to the ip,
    instead being able to listen to the radio waves,
     in witch the computer sends the tempory encrypterd key

step2: 
    listen to traffic (for the wpa2 handshake) using sniffer 
step3:
    to attack the handshake and open new keys using diffrent passwords, and geting the otehr parms (mac addreses and the two random nums) -
    by listening to the radio waves, after you get the right key you will get the inner key, using it you can listen and communicate with devices on the network

keyPoints- the rauter can't know that im trying to guess the password, how i do it:
instead of sending the rauter the temporary key that im creating i will check on my own if its the right key,
 ill do that by checking if can i understand the encrypted msg he sends, and only when i get the right key i send it to the rauter and im IN
