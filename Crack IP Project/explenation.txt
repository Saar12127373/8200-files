This will be my second project, includes a fue steps that will help me crack to local network wifi- WPA2 Private

step 1:
    Deotitication: to be able to take somone out of the ip, the reason i do that is to not be depended of somone trying to connect to the ip,
    instead being able to make the WPA2 handshake occur, then ill enter step2.

step2: 
    I'll use the window that i created and listen to traffic (for the wpa2 handshake) using sniffer and geting the temporary encrypted key, after that i ender step3.

step3:
    To attack the handshake and open new keys using diffrent passwords, and geting the other parms (mac addreses and the two random nums) -
    by listening to the radio waves, after you get the right key you will get the inner key, using it you can listen and communicate with devices on the network

keyPoints- 
    I must use monitor mode (on my network card) so i can listen to the packets even if there not especially meant to me (not for my mac addr).

    The rauter can't know that im trying to guess the password, how i do it:
    instead of sending the rauter the temporary key that im creating i will check on my own if its the right key,
    ill do that by checking if can i understand the encrypted msg he sends, and only when i get the right key i send it to the rauter and im IN
